# claudius: Analytic computations for scattering

Python toolbox to compute scattered and total field when we have analytical computation so typically when scatters are invariant by rotation and the incident field is a plane wave.

The word _claudius_ is an acronym for _CaLculs AnalytiqUes pour la DIffUSion des ondes_ the French translation of analytic computations for scattering or it can also be an acronym for _Computing anaLyticAlly and Uniquely Diverse fIeld Used in Scattering_.

## Requirements

- require: [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) and [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)
- optional: [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) (it is only use for plotting)
- development: [black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort), [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest), and [pytest-cov](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov)

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zmoitier/claudius.git
```
